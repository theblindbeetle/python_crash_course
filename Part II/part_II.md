# PART II
### Now, you know enough about Python to start building interactive and meaningful projects.
This part contains three types of projects, and you can choose to do
any or all of them in the order you prefer. Here's a brief description
of the projects:

---
## II ~  1 Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python
In chapters 12, 13, and 14 you'll learn the *Pygame* package to develop a 
2D game, where the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens.

---
## II ~  2 Data Visualization
In chapter 15 you'll learn to generate data and create a series of functional
and beautiful visualizations using *Matplotlib* and *Plotly*.<br>

The chapter 16 teaches you to access data from online sources and
feed it into visualization packages to create plots of weather data 
and a map of global earthquake activity.

And the Chapter 17 shows you how to download and visualize data automatically.
Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of
data mining.

## II ~ 3 Web Applications
In the Web Application project (chapters 18, 19, and 20), you'll use the
*Django* package to create a simple web application that allows users
to keep a journal about any number of topics they've been learning about.
